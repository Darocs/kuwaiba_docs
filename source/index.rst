Welcome to Kuwaiba's documentation!
===================================

**Kuwaiba** is an open-source Java framework for Inventory Application with primarily focus at Telecom.
Kuwaiba addressed to the middle level companies with mature processes and automation desire. Being developed 
with practice in mind, Kuwaiba delivers unique flexibility that makes it not *yet another inventory*, but let 
it act as a framework to be suited to the customer needs. 
It offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.  `Open-source community <https://sourceforge.net/p/kuwaiba/discussion/>`_ 
will help you to make first steps.

Kuwaiba hosts its documentation on Read the Docs.

Check out the :doc:`onboarding </start/onboarding>` section for further information, including
:ref:`get in touch<let's try>`.

Let's start your Kuwaiba journey...
